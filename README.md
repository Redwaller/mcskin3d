# mcskin3d
The super duper 3d skin editing utility!

Built on the .NET Framework, this program allows you to draw in 3D and 2D to make Minecraft skins for players and mobs/models alike.
Wiki is open for contributions. I am too lazy for this unfortunately.

Just messing around with mcskin3d for now, unsure if I'll actually do anything with this.
